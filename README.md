# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
The Walmart Superstore analyze its sales data to gain insights into its performance and identify opportunities for growth. The company has vast sales data, including information on products, customers, stores, and transactions. Technologies- Data collection, Data visualization , Power BI.
Approach:
Connect to the Walmart sales data source: The first step is to connect to the Walmart
sales data source. Power BI can connect to various data sources, including Excel
spreadsheets, SQL Server databases, and other cloud-based platforms. You can use
Power BI's Walmart connector to connect to the Walmart sales data source.
Import data: Once connected, import the data into Power BI. You can choose to import
the entire dataset or select specific tables and columns that you want to analyze.
Data modeling: After importing the data, create a data model to define the relationships
between the different tables. You can use Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create
the data model.
Create reports: Once the data model is set up, create reports to visualize the data. You
can use Power BI's built-in visualizations or create custom visualizations using Power BI's
developer tools.
Add filters and slicers: To make the reports more interactive, add filters and slicers to
allow users to explore the data in more detail.
Publish the reports: Once the reports are complete, publish them to Power BI service,
where users can access them via web or mobile devices.
Results:
You have to analyse the overall sales of walmart super store data and create various
dashboards using powerbi with the given dataset.

The learning outcomes of this project:
1) Data modeling: You will learn how to create data models that enable effective
analysis, including how to define relationships between tables and calculate
measures.
2) Data visualization: You will learn how to create compelling and interactive
visualizations using Power BI, including how to create charts, graphs, and dashboards
that effectively communicate insights.
3) Report development: You will learn how to develop reports using Power BI,
including how to design report layouts, format data, and create interactive filters.
4) Data integration: You will learn how to integrate data from multiple sources into
Power BI, including how to use Power Query to transform and clean data.
5) Business solution: You will develop a better understanding of how businesses
like Walmart operate and how data analysis can support business decision-making.
Problem-solving: You will learn how to identify business problems and use data
analysis techniques to develop solutions, including how to use Power BI to analyze
sales trends and identify areas for improvement.
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with data extraction,
processing, and visualization, as well as experience working with databases,
dashboards, and web development. This project will provide a foundation for further
learning and development in these areas and help you build a portfolio of practical
skills.

2) Predict the Profit of Walmart using the power analysis and also represent the data in
hierarchial as well as the area in series of data points.
3) Describe and visualize the principle that 80 percent of the sales come from 20 percent
of the customers and also create a visual that would breakdown measures into
underlying factors and analyse the sales using the metrics in the data.
4) Make a presentation using the dashboards of sale analysis:

 Sales and Revenue: You can track the store's sales and revenue over
time, by category, region, and product.

as sales per square foot, customer traffic, and employee productivity,
to identify areas of improvement and optimize store operations.
5) Design and upload the report in power bi service and kindly attach the report link.
6) Perform root cause analysis and also make inferences in a report format.
